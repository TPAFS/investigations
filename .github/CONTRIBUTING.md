# Contributing to investigations

Thanks for considering making a contribution to this effort! We gratefully accept issue submissions and pull requests (PRs) from community members to help support this work.

What follows is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository. This is a living document, and we hope you will feel free to propose alterations to this guidance just like everything else in this repository.

## Before Contributing

Before contributing to this repository, please read this [welcome post](https://github.com/TPAFS/investigations/discussions/8), and introduce yourself if you'd like to. If you plan to contribute in ways other than discussion, please be sure to check if other existing or ongoing work is related to what you will do, and communicate your intentions to work on something (prior to doing all the hard work!) if it is a time consuming effort, via discussion or issues. This helps ensure community members don't waste their precious time duplicating each other's work, or working on something that might not have community support.

## How Can I Contribute?

Anything you can do to help further the goals of this work (see `README.md` for more details on what those goals are) is welcome
and sincerely appreciated. Below are a few ideas for what this might look like, to get you started.
