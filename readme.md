## Running Notebooks

Install python requirements in a virtual environment, e.g. via:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env
source ./.env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

from the top level of this directory.

Each notebook in each investigation should now be usable in a self-contained way.
